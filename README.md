# LoL Simulator
 A passion project based on my favorite and very popular mmo game League of Legends. LoL simulator 
 
#### Pseudo

1. UI allows user to insert two champions to 1 versus 1
2. Make an API call to LoL API to gather information on requested champions. Stats, common itemizations, etc. 
3. (Maybe) allow the user to select custom itemization for each champion. 
4. Build a test basis for a 'simulation' between the two champions given their statistics at level 18 and itemization. 
5. Run the simulation test 50 times and return the overall results.
